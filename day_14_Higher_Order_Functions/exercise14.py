# -------------------Exercise Higher Order Function----------------------

# Explain the difference between map, filter and reduce
# map function applies the function passed as a parameters over all the items of the list. It return a iterable
# filter function allows you to filter the items of the list  by means of a function. Iy return a iterable
# reduce function applies the function passed as a parameters  over all the items and return a single value

# Explain the difference between higher order function, closure and decorator
# The Higher Order Function is a function that operates with another function or functions.
# It contains other functions as input parameters or it return a function as output.
# Closures are internal functions that are enclosed  within the external function.
# It can access variables present in the scope of the external function
# Decorator allows to add new functionality to an existing object without modifying its structure
